	<h1>Your ship</h1>
<p>You own a spaceship. Right now, she's a basic/normal cargo, with a limited load,
limited armor, limited weapons. But she "does the job" pretty well, for now.</p>
<p>Of course, during the game, you'll have the opportunity to improve her, by buying
new stuff and assemble it to your ship.</p>
<p>Pick a "Ship Sheet" (you can use a simple index card if you like) and fill it
following the steps below.</p>
<h2>Pick her name</h2>
<p>Find her a proper, cool name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solo example</strong></p>
<p>Dante Hewett has decided to give his ship the name of a woman he once loved:
“Eladia”. How romantic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do the maths</h2>
<p>You'll have to assigne stats to your ship, too.</p>
<h3>Armor</h3>
<p>Resistance to the attacks. The more you have, the better you are protected
against Weapons.</p>
<h3>Weaponry</h3>
<p>The capacity to attack an other spaceship and provoke damages. The more you have,
the bigger these damages will be.</p>
<h3>Load</h3>
<p>This stat is not a bonus. It represents the maximum cargo load.</p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>Again, this is not a bonus. It represents the energy left to propel the Ship 
from planets to planets.</p>
<h2>Game Start</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the game, when you're a "newbie". And your ship may look
poor, but she's your best friend.</p>
<p>Please take note of these stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>-1 Armor,</li>
<li>-1 Weaponry,</li>
<li>4 cargo load,</li>
<li>100 energy units</li>
</ul>
