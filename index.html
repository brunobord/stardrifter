	<h1>Stardrifter</h1>
<p>Stardrifter is a tabletop solo role-playing game about being a Trader / Smuggler
in a science-fiction galaxy-wide settings.</p>
<p>In this game you'll be given a spaceship, a few credits, basic weapons and
you'll be free to sail this ship from planets to planets to sell, buy, or even
hijack other stardrifters.</p>
<p>It borrows a lot from <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42361/pocket-dungeon">Pocket Dungeon</a>, by Jonathan Gilmour,
since the star systems in the galaxy are usually not pre-generated, but they're
made up <strong>during the game itself</strong>, using a few dice rolls.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Stardrifter is meant to be published in many formats. The texts will be written
using Markdown, and thus can be (and hopefully <em>will be</em>) available in PDF, ePub
and HTML.</p>
<p>I may have the opportunity to help the players by providing tools (small scripts,
and why not an online world generator, etc).</p>
