<p>You're going to spend a lot of time in your spaceship... Hopefully, not in real-
time. Space travel has become easier, if not mundane. Jumping from a World to
another is a matter of weeks, now.</p>
<p>Have a look at your <a href="../static/sheets/map.html">Galactic Map</a>. Consider the distance between 2 worlds.
To calculate its distance, you only have to count how many hexes you need to
cross to get from one World to the other. Each hex is a parsec-wide.</p>
<p>So, how long does it take? It takes three full weeks to make a parsec. Simple as
it is. When you'll be able to <a href="../marketplace/">improve your ship hyperdrive</a>,
you'll be able to reduce the time needed to travel a parsec.</p>
<h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>
<p>Here is how you travel from a World to another:</p>
<ol>
<li>calculate the distance in parsec.</li>
<li>calculate the time required to cross this distance.</li>
<li><em>roll+Drift</em> to see if you did calculate properly your coordinates. see Drift table below for results. Adjust time required.</li>
<li>for each week on board, roll on the Hazard Table.</li>
<li>if something must happen (encounters, damages, etc), resolve the situation.</li>
<li>substract 3 Energy points for this week on board.</li>
<li>substract 20 credits from your Wealth to mesure the food and other material you've consumed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat steps 4 to 7 for each week on board until you've arrived.</p>

<p>Results are rounded up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dante wants to travel from Danbrilldal to Orde√Øana, which is only 3 parsecs apart.
Normal time required to get there should be:</p>
<p>3 x 3 = 9 weeks</p>
<p>Dante rolls+Drift, and despite his +3 Bonus, he does a 5. That's stupid, he
did wrong calculations while he was thinking he could use better wormholes
to get faster to his destination.</p>
<p>Now it's 9 x 1.5 = 13.5, so it'll take <strong>14 weeks</strong> (rounded up). Very bad
Drifting, dear Dante...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-you-may-encounter">What you may encounter</h2>
<h3 id="space-patrol">Space Patrol</h3>
<p>The Space Patrol is responsible of the security on the "space roads" you'll take
from a World to another. They can do anything to your ship. Arrest it, get into
it to control the cargo load, check if everything is okay. If they find illegal
merchandise, they can confiscate the cargo, the ship and send you to jail.</p>
<p>If you refuse the inspection, they can get angry and attack you.</p>
<h3 id="smugglers">Smugglers</h3>
<p>Usually they're okay. Except when they're in need of money. If they recognize
one of theirs (i.e. another Smuggler), it'll be usually easier to pass by their
ship unharmed... except, again, if they're in need.</p>
<h3 id="pirates">Pirates</h3>
<p>Pirates never attack other Pirates. But you shouldn't try to <em>pretend</em> to be a
Pirate if you're not... they'd get <strong>very</strong> angry.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Pirates don't  attack your ship, even if it's obviously fully loaded
with nice merchandise. Maybe that's because their cargo load is full, or because
their Weaponry is broken, etc.</p>
<p>If you're lucky enough, take your chance. If not, prepare yourself to have a 
fight to death.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try to <em>Parley</em> (i.e. Negociate) to save your ship.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-what-happened">And now, what happened?</h2>
<p>You have to roll+Reputation to discover what happens this week.</p>
