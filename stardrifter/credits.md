Title: Credits

This game is designed by Bruno Bord, with the kind support of his family.


## Inspirations

It borrows a lot from [Pocket Dungeon][Pocket Dungeon], by Jonathan Gilmour, 
especially the point where Worlds are created "during the game", on the go.

It shares bits with [Stars Without Numbers][], with its very extensive World /
Culture Generator. Of course, Stardrifter will never reach that level of details,
but stil, Stars Without Numbers sandboxing is an excellent resource.

You may remember a 1993 video-game called [Privateer][]. Stardrifter can be
considered as a solo tabletop version of Privateer.

## Under the hood

This game is being edited with [Sublime Text 2][], using
[Github-flavoured Markdown][Markdown].

The HTML templates are built around [Twitter Bootstrap][], and gracefully
rendered by [Jinja2][], using the power of a tiny [Python][] script.

I'm only using four webfonts to avoid the ugly Verdana or worse, Papyrus:

* [Iceland][] for titles,
* [Droid Sans][Droid] for the main text,
* [Droid Sans Mono][Droid] for the monospaced text (notes, tables, etc),
* [Ubuntu][] for quotes.
* [Rock Salt][Rock Salt] for handwriting logbook

All these webfonts are provided by [Google Webfonts][]

Logbook style is inspired by the ["Passin' me by" theme][Passin' me by] available
on the excellent [Typespiration website][Typespiration]

The Hex Map is rendered using [this SVG experiment][hexmap-ref], by Josh Bassett.
