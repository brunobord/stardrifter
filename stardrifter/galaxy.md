Title: The Galaxy World Generator


The basic idea behind Stardrifter is that one can play it without preparation,
without having to previously generate Planets, Worlds, beforehand.

At the beginning of the game, you'll have to roll for your initial location.
Everytime you'll want to go from where you are to a **new planet**, you'll have
to roll to generate a new world.

# How to draw the Galaxy map

The easiest way to draw your Galactic map will be to use [Hex Maps][HexMap].
You'll find tons of HexMap generators, including PDFs you may want to print
before starting to play.

# A new World

Whatever it is, you initial location or your next destination, you'll have to
follow a few steps to generate a new World.

Pick a "World sheet" (you can use a simple index card if you want).

## 1. Name your world

It has to be "Cosmologic". e.g.: Beta Hydri Major, Araknor, Rhat'hiiy'y, etc.
Use your imagination, there's no established rule. Pick random numbers if you
want. The name of the planet has to be unique, to be able to retrieve its sheet
later on. Again, on the Web, you will find many Planet name generators.

> **Solo Example**
> 
> At the beginning of his adventures, Dante is located on the Planet
> *Danbrilldal*.

Grab your Hex Map. If this world is you Initial Location, and draw a spot in the
middle of the map, and write the name of the planet beside.

## 2. Distance

!!! note "Skip it"
    You can skip this step if its your Initial Location.

How far is this world from where you are **right now**?

Roll 2D6: it's the distance, in "parsecs" from your location to the other one.
Grab your Hex Map. Each Hexagon equals a "parsec". Thus, it should be separated
by the same number of hexes than the distance you've just rolled.

## 3. Wealth, resources, stuff

Since not every planet is equal, you are likely to find some resources on one
planet, and some are rare. You'll have to roll for each possible resource:

### Legal resources

1. Vegetable food 
2. Animal food (meat)
3. Construction materials
4. Tools, mechanics
5. Electronic stuff
6. Energy

### Illegal resources

1. Weapons
2. Slaves
3. Drugs

Roll 2D6 for each and write its score on the World sheet.

### A quick note about prices

Prices vary, but the reference is "Capital Price", that is to say the "Street price"
when you're on Capital Planet. On each planet, we will have to adjust the price
according to the natural resources available on the planet.

!!! note "Round the price" 
    Please note that the prices will be rounded down. e.g.:
    150 * 1.25 = 187.5 = 187

## Capital prices

Price is per cargo unit.

> Excellent! I know that my character is in a place where Energy is cheap, but
> the other goods are at reasonable price.

These prices will be used when you'll head to the [Marketplace][marketplace]

Your World is now complete. Enjoy your stay!

!!!rule "Alternate rule"

    Basic rule set a price for all the available merchandise, once for all. But if
    you want to make it a bit more accurate, prices can change over time.

    When you come back to a World, make a re-roll for every good available, and note
    its new price. Sometimes they may go up, sometimes down.
