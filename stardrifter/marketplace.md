Title: Buy & Sell

# Buy and Sell

Take your World Sheet, your Ship Sheet and your Character Sheet and check if you
want to buy or sell goods. You'll be able to buy Merchandises (things to trade
from a World to another), sell these Merchandise, or buy things to improve your
ship performances.

On the World Sheet, you see the price of available goods. On the Ship Sheet, you
can see how many cargo load unit are available. On the Character Sheet, you can
see how much credit you have and what is your *Negociate* score.

## Buy Merchandise

Every time you want to buy things, you first pick the item and the quantity you
want to buy. Then you roll **2D6+Negociate**. See the result below:

| Roll       | Result                                                     |
|:---------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 6 or less  | The item you want to buy is 25% more expensive             | 
| 7-9        | The item you want to buy is available at its normal price  |
| 10 or more | The item you want to buy is 25% less expensive             |
