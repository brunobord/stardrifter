Title: Buy & Sell

Take your World Sheet, your Ship Sheet and your Character Sheet and check if you
want to buy or sell goods. You'll be able to buy Merchandises (things to trade
from a World to another), sell these Merchandise, or buy things to improve your
ship performances.

On the World Sheet, you see the price of available goods. On the Ship Sheet, you
can see how many cargo load unit are available. On the Character Sheet, you can
see how much credit you have and what is your *Negociate* score.

# Buy Merchandise

Every time you want to buy things, you first pick the item and the quantity you
want to buy. Then you *roll+Negociate*. See the result below:

> Dante Hewett has 4000 credits, poor Negociation skills (-1) and has a full

> What about buying 2 units of "Energy" to sell them next time?...
> Energy is at a very low price on this planet, so he can expect a large benefit.
> But first, he has to buy them at the Market. He rolls+Negociate to see if he
> can try to have a rebate on the "street price".
> He rolls 4 & 5, then adds "-1"... it's a poor 8. He's buying them at the
> regular price, i.e. 2 * 100 = 200.
> 
> Next is "Electronics". A little bit higher than Capital prices, but still
> interesting, if he can find out a good customer. He's tring to buy 2 units.
> He rolls 1 & 5, so his result is 5. Bad things. The normal price is 187, and
> because of his poor Negociation skills, he's buying these Electronics at
> 187 * 1.25 * 2 = 467 credits.
> 
> On the Ship Sheet, I'm writing down that the 4 Cargo Load are taken by
> "Energy" and "Electronics".
> On his Character Sheet, we must state he has 4000 - 200 - 467 = 3333 credits
> left.

> Now Dante is ready to sail away to another World...
