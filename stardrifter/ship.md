# Your ship

You own a spaceship. Right now, it's a basic/normal cargo, with a limited load,
limited armor, limited weapons. But it "does the job" pretty well, for now.

Of course, during the game, you'll have the opportunity to improve it, by buying
new stuff and assemble it to your ship.

Each ship has a few stats

## Speed

Represent the Speed in Chase mode (combat and tactics) and using Hyperdrive (long
trail, travelling from a planet to another).

## Armor

Resistance to the attacks. The more you have, the better you are protected against
Weapons.

## Weaponry

The capacity to attack an other spaceship and provoke damages.
