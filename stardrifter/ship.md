# Your ship

You own a spaceship. Right now, she's a basic/normal cargo, with a limited load,
limited armor, limited weapons. But she "does the job" pretty well, for now.

Of course, during the game, you'll have the opportunity to improve her, by buying
new stuff and assemble it to your ship.

Pick a "Ship Sheet" (you can use a simple index card if you like) and fill it
following the steps below.

## Pick her name

Find her a proper, cool name.

> Dante Hewett has decided to give his ship the name of a woman he once loved:
> “Eladia”. How romantic.

## Do the maths

You'll have to assigne stats to your ship, too.

### Armor

Resistance to the attacks. The more you have, the better you are protected
against Weapons.

### Weaponry

The capacity to attack an other spaceship and provoke damages. The more you have,
the bigger these damages will be.

### Load

This stat is not a bonus. It represents the maximum cargo load.

### Energy

Again, this is not a bonus. It represents the energy left to propel the Ship 
from planets to planets.

## Game Start

At the beginning of the game, when you're a "newbie". And your ship may look
poor, but she's your best friend.

Please take note of these stats:

* -1 Armor,
* -1 Weaponry,
* 4 cargo load,
* 100 energy units
