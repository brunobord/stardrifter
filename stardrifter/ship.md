# Your ship

You own a spaceship. Right now, it's a basic/normal cargo, with a limited load,
limited armor, limited weapons. But it "does the job" pretty well, for now.

Of course, during the game, you'll have the opportunity to improve it, by buying
new stuff and assemble it to your ship.

Each ship has a few stats

## Do the maths

### Armor

Resistance to the attacks. The more you have, the better you are protected
against Weapons.

### Weaponry

The capacity to attack an other spaceship and provoke damages. The more you have,
the bigger these damages will be.

### Load

This stat is not a bonus. It represents the maximum cargo load.

## Game Start

At the beginning of the game, when you're a "newbie", your ship has -1 Armor and
-1 Weaponry. Yes, it's a poor ship, but very valuable.

It has 4 cargo load.
