# Your ship

You own a spaceship. Right now, she's a basic/normal cargo, with a limited load,
limited armor, limited weapons. But she "does the job" pretty well, for now.

Of course, during the game, you'll have the opportunity to improve her, by buying
new stuff and assemble it to your ship.

## Her name

Find her a proper, cool name.

> Dante Hewett has decided to give his ship the name of a woman he once loved:
> “Eladia”. How romantic.

## Do the maths

You'll have to assigne stats to your ship, too.

### Armor

Resistance to the attacks. The more you have, the better you are protected
against Weapons.

### Weaponry

The capacity to attack an other spaceship and provoke damages. The more you have,
the bigger these damages will be.

### Load

This stat is not a bonus. It represents the maximum cargo load.

## Game Start

At the beginning of the game, when you're a "newbie", your ship has -1 Armor and
-1 Weaponry. Yes, it's a poor ship, but she's your best friend.

It has 4 cargo load.
