# You are...

You are a trader. Or a smuggler. Or anyone that has an interest in jumping from
planet to planet in the deep space with a full load of merchandise, to be sold
at the best price, and you may buy some more on other worlds. Or, if you want to
dive into piracy, you may try to attack space cargos and steal them.

# Your character

You'll first need to choose a few things out before starting your adventure:

## Your name

Well... it's a solo game, but please, no, don't pick "Han Solo". It's up to you.

## Your class

You have three basic choices, each one of them with pros and cons:

* *Trader*: you're a regular merchant, you usually take care of legal stuff, and
  always pay the right price. Space patrols won't usually bother you ; but take
  care of bad encounters on your way.
* *Smuggler*: Everything is not black or white. Sometimes you're assigned legal
  cargo, sometimes you know it's illegal. Space patrols don't like you and they
  just dream to snatch you as soon as they could.
* *Pirate*: PLANET AHOY! you don't want a patron, you don't want to deal with
  customers. Life is short! You'll only have to let yourself drift between
  stars, waiting for poor innocent traders to be raided. Your loot will be drunk
  and spent in other weaponry, armor and fuel for your pirate ship.

# Your ship

You own a spaceship. Right now, it's a basic/normal cargo, with a limited load,
limited armor, limited weapons. But it "does the job" pretty well, for now.
