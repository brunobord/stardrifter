# You are...

You are a drifter. A merchant, a smuggler or a pirate. You are jumping from
planet to planet in the deep space with a full load of merchandise, to be sold
at the best price, and you may buy some more on other worlds. Or, if you want to
dive into piracy, you may try to attack space cargos and steal them.

You'll first need to work a few things out before starting your adventure:

## Pick a name

Well... it's a solo game, but please, no, don't pick "Han Solo".

## Your stats

Each character has stats, of course.

### Negociate

A bit of charm, a bit of persuasion. Useful when you want to bargain, discuss
with Space Patrol officiers who want to snatch you or parley with Pirates.

### Pilot

The knowledge of physics, astrophysics, hyperdrive and space-travel, combined
with the combat/tactics science of dodging and escaping when involved in space
fight.

### Fight

Your capacity to fight in the air, find the best position to attack your
opponent with the maximum of damages.

### Special stat: Reputation

The higher, the better is your reputation. You're well-known and respected by
other Spacedrifters, Space patrols and local planet governors. Great if you're
in legal trade, but can be a bad when you're a Pirate. When this score is
negative, you're well-known too, but for evil and illegal deeds: murder, raids,
traffic.

**Special rule**: When this stat is reaching +6 or -6, your character becomes a
legend. I think you can stop playing and retire... And start with a new
character.

## How high are your stats?

First of all, assign factors to your stats. You must assign **-2, -1, 0, +1**.
Yes, when you add them, the result is negative. Hey, you're new in this game,
don't you remember?

Further then, you will pick a class and roll dice for your origin, and apply
the designated modfiers.

## Your class

You have three basic choices, each one of them with pros and cons:

### Trader

You're a regular merchant, you usually take care of legal stuff, and
always pay the right price. Space patrols won't usually bother you ; but take
care of bad encounters on your way.

    Apply a +1 to Negociate, -1 to Fight and +1 to Reputation.

### Smuggler

Everything is not black or white. Sometimes you're assigned legal
cargo, sometimes you know it's illegal. Space patrols don't like you and they
just dream to snatch you as soon as they could.

    Apply a +1 to Pilot, -1 to Reputation, +1 to Negociate.

### Pirate

PLANET AHOY! you don't want a patron, you don't want to deal with
customers. Life is short! You'll only have to let yourself drift between
stars, waiting for poor innocent traders to be raided. Your loot will be drunk
and spent in other weaponry, armor and fuel for your pirate ship.

    Apply a +1 to Fight, -1 to Reputation, +1 to Pilot.

## Your origin

All PC are Humans, but they may come from various areas of the galaxy. Roll 1D6
to tell where you're from:

### Table 1.1: Origins

| Roll | Origin            |
|:---- |:------------------|
| 1-2  | Capital planet    | 
| 3-5  | The Surroundings  |
| 6    | The Outer Arms    |

### Capital planet

You come from the main planet of the Galaxy, its "center" in a way. It's the
richest place in the Galaxy. You are educated and versed in the Galactic Lore.

    Add +1 to Negociate.

### The Surroundings

You come from close-from-the center planets. They're usually quite rich areas,
but not as rich as Capital Planet.

    Add +1 to Pilot.

### The Outer Arms

Some of the coldest and farthest worlds in the Galaxy. Your world is a hard
place, people are tough, you had to fight to survive. You don't know much about
Galactic Lore.

    Add +1 to Fight.

## Possessions and wealth

At the beginning of the game, your character has a basic ship (see the "Ship"
chapter for more details), and a few credits.

* Roll 1D6,
* Add +2 if you come from the Central Planet, +1 if you come from the
  Surroundings.
* Multiply this result by 1000, and there are your credits


> **Solo example**
> 
> Let's play Stardrifter! My character will be named Dante Hewett. I've
> chosen him to be a Smuggler, just because I don't want him to be too nasty or
> too gentle.  
>
> I've assigned stats this way:
>
> * Negociate: -2
> * Reputation: -1
> * Pilot: +1
> * Fight: 0
>
>
> I'm now rolling for Origins: it's a 3. Dante is coming from the Surroundings,
> so I am applying both Class and Origin modifiers.
>
> Now my characters stats are:
> 
> * Negociate: -1
> * Reputation: -2
> * Pilot: +3
> * Fight: 0
>
> Well, it looks like I'm a hell of a pilot, but my tongue is not as skillful.

There we go to the next chapter, i.e. my Spaceship.
