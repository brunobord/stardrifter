# Stardrifter

Stardrifter is a solo game about being a Trader / Smuggler in a science-fiction
galaxy-wide settings.

In this game you'll be given a spaceship, a few credits, basic weapons and
you'll be free to sail this ship from planets to planets to sell, buy, or even
hijack other stardrifters.

It borrows a lot from
[Pocket Dungeon](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42361/pocket-dungeon), by
Jonathan Gilmour, since the star systems in the galaxy are usually not
pre-generated, but they're made up **during the game itself**, using a few
dice rolls.
