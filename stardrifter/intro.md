Title: Introduction to Stardrifter


Stardrifter is a tabletop solo role-playing game about being a Trader / Smuggler
in a science-fiction galaxy-wide settings.

In this game you'll be given a spaceship, a few credits, basic weapons and
you'll be free to sail this ship from planets to planets to sell, buy, or even
hijack other stardrifters.

It borrows a lot from [Pocket Dungeon][Pocket Dungeon], by Jonathan Gilmour,
since the star systems in the galaxy are usually not pre-generated, but they're
made up **during the game itself**, using a few dice rolls.

# Goals

Stardrifter is meant to be published in many formats. The texts will be written
using Markdown, and thus can be (and hopefully *will be*) available in PDF, ePub
and HTML.

I may have the opportunity to help the players by providing tools (small scripts,
and why not an online world generator, etc).

Since this game is Free as in speech and beer,
[you can visit its source and other stuff on Github][Stardrifter Github].
