Title: Starting your adventure...


Welcome to this Galaxy! You know who you are, and what are your posessions /
wealth, but... Where are you exactly? You'll need to find out first. Please go
to the [Galaxy World Generator][galaxy]. In this part you'll find out a  way to
create your first world, randomly assign its resources and make it *real*...
well... kinda.

Once you're done, and have filled its World sheet down, come back here and see
the different choices you have.

# What will you do?

## Go to the Marketplace

As long as you have money, you can buy things at the market. You can sell stuff
at the market, too, as long as you have something to sell.

Everything you can or cannot do at the Market is described in the
[Marketplace Section][marketplace]

## Travel to another World

If you have some energy left in your spaceship tank, you can decide to *drift
away* and head to an other World. You have 2 possibilities. Decide to travel
to a New World, or travel to a World you already know.

If it's the latter, you already know how to reach it, using a direct or an
indirect way.

If you want to drift to a New World, you'll have to generate it first. Go to
the [Galaxy World Generator][galaxy], and build your future destination.

!!! rule "Alternate rule"

    You can decide to generate from one to three new Worlds, place them on the
    Galaxy Map and decide where you think it's more interesting to *drift away*.

When you're done and you know where your destination is, you can go to the
[Travel Section][travel]
