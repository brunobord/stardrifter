Title: Travel

# Hyperspace and beyond

You're going to spend a lot of time in your spaceship... Hopefully, not in real-
time. Space travel has become easier, if not mundane. Jumping from a World to
another is a matter of weeks, now.

Have a look at your [Galactic Map][map]. Consider the distance between 2 worlds.
To calculate its distance, you only have to count how many hexes you need to
cross to get from one World to the other. Each hex is a parsec-wide.

So, how long does it take? It takes three full weeks to make a parsec. Simple as
it is. When you'll be able to [improve your ship hyperdrive][marketplace],
you'll be able to reduce the time needed to travel a parsec.

# Travel

Here is how you travel from a World to another:

1. calculate the distance in parsec.
2. calculate the time required to cross this distance.
3. roll+Drift to see if you did calculate properly your coordinates. see Drift table below for results. Adjust time required.
4. for each week on board, roll on the Hazard Table.
5. if something must happen (encounters, damages, etc), resolve the situation.
6. substract 3 Energy points for this week on board.
7. substract 20 credits from your Wealth to mesure the food and other material you've consumed.

Repeat steps 4 to 7 for each week on board until you've arrived.

## Hazards

You have to roll+Reputation to discover what happens this week.
