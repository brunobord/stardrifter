		<article class="span9">
			<p>You are a <em>drifter</em>. A merchant, a smuggler or a pirate. You are jumping from
planet to planet in the deep space with a full load of merchandise, to be sold
at the best price, and you may buy some more on other worlds. Or, if you want to
dive into piracy, you will attack space cargos and steal them.</p>
<p>You'll first need to work a few things out before starting your adventure:</p>
<h1 id="build-your-character">Build your character</h1>
<h2 id="pick-a-name">Pick a name</h2>
<p>Well... it's a solo game, but please, no, don't pick "Han Solo".</p>
<h2 id="your-stats">Your stats</h2>
<p>Stats reflect how skilled your character is in various actions needed when you
want to live the life of the Drifter.</p>
<h3 id="negociate">Negociate</h3>
<p>A bit of charm, a bit of persuasion. Useful when you want to bargain, discuss
with Space Patrol officiers who want to snatch you or parley with Pirates.</p>
<h3 id="drift">Drift</h3>
<p>The knowledge of physics, astrophysics, hyperdrive and space-travel, combined
with the art of dodging and escaping when involved in space fight.</p>
<h3 id="fight">Fight</h3>
<p>Your capacity to fight in the air, choose the right tactics, find the best
position to attack your opponent with the maximum of damages.</p>
<h3 id="special-stat-reputation">Special stat: Reputation</h3>
<p>The higher, the better is your reputation. You're well-known and respected by
other Spacedrifters, Space patrols and local planet governors. Great if you're
in legal trade, but can be bad when you're a Pirate. When this score is
negative, you're well-known too, but for evil and illegal deeds: murder, raids,
traffic.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Special rule</p>
<p>When this stat is reaching +4 or -4, your character becomes a
legend. I think you can stop playing and retire... And start with a new
character.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="how-high-are-your-stats">How high are your stats?</h2>
<p>First of all, assign factors to your stats. You must assign <strong>-2, -1, 0, +1</strong>.
You've read it right, when you add them, the result is negative. Well, you're
new in this game, don't you remember?</p>
<p>Further then, you will pick a class and roll dice for your origin, and apply
the designated modifiers.</p>
<h2 id="your-class">Your class</h2>
<p>You have three basic choices, each one has pros and cons:</p>
<h3 id="merchant">Merchant</h3>
<p>You're a regular merchant, you usually take care of legal stuff, and
always pay the right price. Space patrols won't usually bother you ; but take
care of bad encounters on your way.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p>Apply a +1 to Negociate, -1 to Fight and +1 to Reputation.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="smuggler">Smuggler</h3>
<p>Everything is not black or white. Sometimes you're assigned legal
cargo, sometimes you know it's illegal. Space patrols don't like you and they
just dream to snatch you as soon as they could.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p>Apply a +1 to Drift, -1 to Reputation, +1 to Negociate.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="pirate">Pirate</h3>
<p>PLANET AHOY! you don't want a patron, you don't want to deal with customers.
Life is short! You'll only have to let yourself drift between stars, waiting for
poor innocent traders to be raided. Your loot will be drunk and spent in other
weaponry, armor and fuel for your pirate ship.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p>Apply a +1 to Fight, -1 to Reputation, +1 to Drift.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="your-origin">Your origin</h2>
<p>Normally, the Playing Characters are Humans, but they come from various areas of
the galaxy. Roll 1D6 to tell where you're from:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Roll</th>
<th align="left">Origin</th>
<th align="left">Modifier</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">1-2</td>
<td align="left">Capital planet</td>
<td align="left">+1 Negociate</td>

<td align="left">+1 Drift</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">6</td>
<td align="left">The Outer Arms</td>
<td align="left">+1 Fight</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="capital-planet">Capital planet</h3>
<p>You come from the main planet of the Galaxy, its "center" in a way. It's the
richest place in the Galaxy. You are educated and versed in the Galactic Lore.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p>Add +1 to Negociate.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-surroundings">The Surroundings</h3>
<p>You come from close-from-the center planets. They're usually rich and educated
areas, but not as rich as Capital Planet.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p>Add +1 to Drift.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-outer-arms">The Outer Arms</h3>
<p>Some of the coldest and farthest worlds in the Galaxy. Your world is a hard
place, people are tough, you had to fight to survive. You don't know much about
Galactic Lore and Etiquette. And you don't care.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p>Add +1 to Fight.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="possessions-and-wealth">Possessions and wealth</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the game, your character has a basic ship (see the "Ship"
chapter for more details), and a few credits.</p>
<div class="admonition rule">
<p class="admonition-title">Roll for wealth</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll 1D6,</li>
<li>Add +2 if you come from the Central Planet, +1 if you come from the
  Surroundings.</li>
<li>Multiply this result by 1000, and there are your credits</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solo example</strong></p>
<p>Let's play Stardrifter! My character will be named Dante Hewett. I've
chosen him to be a Smuggler, just because I don't want him to be too nasty or
too gentle.  </p>
<p>I've assigned stats this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negociate: -2</li>
<li>Reputation: -1</li>
<li>Drift: +1</li>
<li>Fight: 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm now rolling for Origins: it's a <strong>3</strong>. Dante is coming from the Surroundings,
so I am applying both Class and Origin modifiers.</p>
<p>Now my characters stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negociate: -1</li>
<li>Reputation: -2</li>
<li>Drift: +3</li>
<li>Fight: 0</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it looks like I'm a hell of a drifter, but my tongue is not as skillful.</p>
<p>I'm now rolling for wealth: it's a <strong>3</strong> again. I'm adding 1, since Hewett is
coming from the Surroundings, and here's my money: 4000 credits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-use-your-stats">How to use your stats?</h2>
<p>During the game, you'll be asked to roll dice associated with a stat. The roll
will be noted: <em>roll+Negociate</em>, or <em>roll+Reputation</em>.</p>
<p>It means you'll have to roll two 6-side-dice and add the designated stat to it.
Usually, a result with 10 or more will be a success ; a result with 6 or less is
a failure. A result between 7 and 9 will be a partial success ; you'll succeed,
but you'll experience little drawbacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solo Example</strong></p>
<p>Dante is being asked to <em>roll+Drift</em> to perform evasive maneuvers.
He rolls 1 and 6, and adds his <em>Drift</em> score (+3). That's a 10. His roll is 
successful, he manages to escape without trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may happen that you'll have to roll+Reputation <strong>or</strong> roll-Reputation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's imagine that a character Reputation equals to "-2". Rolling roll+Reputation
means it'll be a "-2 roll". If it's being asked to roll-Reputation, it means
its a "+2 roll".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we're going to look after your <em>best friend</em>: <a href="../ship/">your spaceship</a>.</p>
