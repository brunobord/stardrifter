			<p>Take your World Sheet, your Ship Sheet and your Character Sheet and check if you
want to buy or sell goods. You'll be able to buy Merchandises (things to trade
from a World to another), sell these Merchandise, or buy things to improve your
ship performances.</p>
<p>On the World Sheet, you see the price of available goods. On the Ship Sheet, you
can see how many cargo load unit are available. On the Character Sheet, you can
see how much credit you have and what is your <em>Negociate</em> score.</p>
<h1 id="buy-merchandise">Buy Merchandise</h1>
<p>Every time you want to buy things, you first pick the item and the quantity you
want to buy. Then you <em>roll+Negociate</em>. See the result below:</p>
<table>

<p>Dante Hewett has 4000 credits, poor Negociation skills (-1) and has a full
cargo load available (4 units). He's now on the Planet Danbrilldal. He wants 
to fill them with goods he could trade on his next destination.</p>
<p>You can <a href="../galaxy/#prices-on-danbrilldal">See the prices on Danbrilldal table</a> for
prices reference.</p>
<p>What about buying 2 units of "Energy" to sell them next time?...
Energy is at a very low price on this planet, so he can expect a large benefit.
But first, he has to buy them at the Market. He rolls+Negociate to see if he
can try to have a rebate on the "street price".
He rolls 4 &amp; 5, then adds "-1"... it's a poor 8. He's buying them at the
regular price, i.e. 2 * 100 = 200.</p>
<p>Next is "Electronics". A little bit higher than Capital prices, but still
interesting, if he can find out a good customer. He's tring to buy 2 units.
He rolls 1 &amp; 5, so his result is 5. Bad things. The normal price is 187, and
because of his poor Negociation skills, he's buying these Electronics at
187 * 1.25 * 2 = 467 credits.</p>
<p>On the Ship Sheet, I'm writing down that the 4 Cargo Load are taken by
"Energy" and "Electronics".
On his Character Sheet, we must state he has 4000 - 200 - 467 = 3333 credits
left.</p>
<p>Now Dante is ready to sail away to another World...</p>
